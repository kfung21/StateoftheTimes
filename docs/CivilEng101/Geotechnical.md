>the application of scientific methods and engineering principles to the acquisition, interpretation, and use of knowledge of materials of the Earth's crust and earth materials for the solution of engineering problems and the design of engineering works. It is the applied science of predicting the behavior of the Earth, its various materials and processes towards making the Earth more suitable for human activities and development. <[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotechnical_engineering)> 

## Where do they work?
Geotechnical Engineers can work at any city, county, state, utilities, or consulting and construction firms. Geotechnical engineers have amongst the most job opprotunities due to the fact that all infrastructure requires soils and foundation work.

## What do they do?
Geotechnical Engineers provide support on all types of projects including dams, levees, wells, roadways, structural walls and building foundations. Geotechnical Engineers are experts in rocks, sediment layers, soils, and various subsurface material foundations. Most will work closeley with the [Federal Energy and Regulatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Energy_Regulatory_Commission). With the recent 2012-2015 drought, new legislation relating to groundwater, and the Oroville Dam spillway collapse, geotechnical engineers have never been in higher demand. Since Geotechnical Engineers interact and work with every discipline, there are opportuniies to crossover into other fields in the future without much trouble. 

When foundational design issues arise, they often make headlines for the wrong reasons. See the [SF Millennium Tower sinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Tower_(San_Francisco)#Sinking_and_tilting_problem) and [Oroville Dam Spillway Failure](https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-oroville-spillway-failure-20170905-story.html).

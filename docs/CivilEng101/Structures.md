>a sub-discipline of civil engineering in which structural engineers are trained to design the 'bones and muscles' that create the form and shape of man made structures. Structural engineers need to understand and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and nonbuilding structures. The structural designs are integrated with those of other designers such as architects and building services engineer and often supervise the construction of projects by contractors on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, and vehicles where structural integrity affects functioning and safety. <[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering)> 

## Where do they work?
Structural Engineers can work at any city, county building or public works departments. Most often, structural engineers will work for consulting, design, and design-build firms that work for private and public agency clients. While opportunities may be more limited than other disciplines, with sufficient experience, Structural Engineers are able to create their own design startup firms and work for themselves.  It is often the highest paid of of all the disciplines, but may have initial lower entry level salaries in order to gain the necessary experience for higher profile clients and projects. 

## What do they do?
Structural Engineers require a SE license to stamp and manage design projects. They are responsible for making sure all building structures are designed to the latest codes and will be held liable in the event of a disaster. One of the largest structural design projects in California history was the new [Eastern Span of the Bay Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_span_replacement_of_the_San_Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland_Bay_Bridge). Lower profile work can include design of retaining walls, small bridges, overpasses, and home remodels.

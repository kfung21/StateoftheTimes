>is the application of technology and scientific principles to the planning, functional design, operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods transport. <[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_engineering)> 

## Where do they work?
Transportation Engineers can work for the Department of Transporation (CalTrans), local transporation agencies (ie: Muni, Bart, AC Transit), planning agencies (MTC, ACTC), airports, cities public works department, or for private consulting firms. 

## What do they do?
Because the work is very broad and overlaps with many disciplines, it is common for people studying mechanical engineering, geotechnical, structures, or water/environmental to work as transportation engineers.  

Transportation engineers are responsible for roadway projects, pavement, bike paths, intersection design, traffic operations, as well as funding and planning. There is often field work involved or meetings with other agencies, so there are many opportunities to work outside the office. However, sometimes site visits can be dangerous when stopping on roadway shoulders.
